import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
// import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// The default service worker is not used: it's overridden instead
// by the ServiceWorkerWrapper (ServiceWorkerWrapper.tsx)

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
// serviceWorker.register();
