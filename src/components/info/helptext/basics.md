the plan is for this text to scroll

scrolling should happen without affecting the top or bottom of the card

to add some vertical space, have some bullet points:

- a
- b
- c

then break, then some more

- d
- e
- f

and again.

- g
- h
- i
- j

then there should be enough content to scroll

if everything has gone according to plan, both the top title and the bottom controls should be visible

if everything has gone according to plan, both the top title and the bottom controls should be visible

- a
- b
- c
