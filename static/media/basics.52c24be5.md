# What the Fractal?

This application showcases two fractals: the **_Mandelbrot set_**, and the **_Julia set_**.
Fractals are structures which exhibit some kind of self-similarity at different scales.

Each half of the screen contains a "**_viewer_**" for one of the fractals.
There are two possible layouts depending on the orientation of your screen:

- _Portrait_ is most common on mobile phones

- _Landscape_ is most common on regular computers
