Mandelbrot Maps is an interactive fractal explorer built using React and WebGL.

Developed by [Joao Maio](https://jmaio.github.io/) between 2019-2021 as part of an Honours Project at The University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of [Philip Wadler](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/).

Freddie's version of the project is available at: [mmaps.freddiejbawden.com](http://mmaps.freddiejbawden.com/)

2020/2021 TBD.

The Tan's Theorem Explorer was contributed by [Fraser Scott](https://github.com/fraserdscott) between 2020-2021 as part of an Honours Project at The University of Edinburgh, also under the supervision of [Philip Wadler](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/).

The [original Mandelbrot Maps project](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/mandelbrot-maps/index.html) was developed by Iain Parris in 2008 as a Java Applet.

Mandelbrot set shader code adapted from [Mandelbrot - smooth](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4df3Rn) by [Inigo Quilez](http://iquilezles.org/).

Deep Zoom (using [Perturbation theory](https://fractalwiki.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory)) adapted from [DeepMandelbrot](https://deep-mandelbrot.js.org/) by [@munsocket](https://github.com/munsocket).
