# Controls

You can pan, zoom, and rotate each viewer independently.
If you have used Google Maps or another maps application, the controls are almost the same, but will depend on the kind of device you are using, and how you interact with it, be it a mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen.

## Mouse

- to pan, **click and drag** on a viewer
- to zoom, **scroll** while hovering over a viewer
- to rotate, **hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and scroll** while hovering over a viewer

## Touchpad

  - **scroll** while hovering over a viewer, or

## Touchscreen
